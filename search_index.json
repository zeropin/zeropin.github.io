Since the discovery of the first transcription factor lac repressor (lacI) in E. coli, there has been tremendous progress in this field, particularly after the wide adoption of high-throughput sequencing technology. However, so many “experts” and “non-experts” study TFs in so many different ways, both experiemntally and computationally, which cause lots of confusion and inconsistent results in various circumstances. As a nerd who has been working in this field for more than 10 years, I feel the need to write a small book myself to clarify some basic concepts of protein-DNA interactions, and demostrate how to design, perform, and analyze transcription factors in principled and logical consistent way. So this is not a encyclopedia on TFs, but a “How to” reference for everyone. This book is an evolving project, currently authored and maintained by Zheng. I certainly welcome more TF researchers to contribute to this online book project in the long run. If you are interested to be part of this effort, please do not hesitate to contact me (zzuo@stanford.edu). 1.1 Why study TFs? To be simple, because life matters. To be honest, because some nerds like me need find some boring topics to sudy, to survice in academia. To be specific, there are ~20,000 genes in human genome, and ~1,500 of them are transcription factors, which control how other genes work. When some mutations happen in those TFs, people get diseases. Understanding how those TFs work can help us figure out how biology works, and why we get sick in many cases. 1.2 Organization of this book 1.3 Who am I? The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Prerequsites", " Chapter 2 Prerequsites This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 2. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!
